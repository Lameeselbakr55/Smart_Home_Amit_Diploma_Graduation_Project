## Project Description 

 It is a master / slave project where Two ECUâ€™s Communicate with each other the first is a control ECU which takes the input from Bluetooth
and send it to the Sink (Actuator) ECU via SPI to interpret which action should be taken

### Example 
When master recievs 1 through UART , it sends to slave to turn lamp 1 on. Also, when master recievs 2 , it sends to slave to turn lamp 2 on. but when  master recievs 3 , it sends to slave to turn lamp 3 on. Finally when master recievs 4 , it sends to slave to turn motor on. otherwise all devices turned off
